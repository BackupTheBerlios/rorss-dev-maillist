Subject: [rorss-dev] Tasks you can do
Message-ID: <4372BF70.1050906@psu.edu>

Hi guys,

In last week's meeting, it was decided that I should start putting a list of 
shorter "upper-level" tasks on the berlios site, so you can now find that list 
at https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=2982 .  It's a work in progress; 
I continue to add things when I can and when I think of them.

If you want to work on one of them, simply log in, click on the task you'd like 
to do, change the "Assigned" field to your name, and click on "Submit Changes". 
  Once you've done that and written something up, either check it in or email 
this list with the code attached or inline.  After that, I'll check it in or 
reply to the list with my comments - everybody else is encouraged to reply with 
comments, too.

I know at least one of you has a midterm, but I still hope to see you all at 
the meeting tomorrow!
