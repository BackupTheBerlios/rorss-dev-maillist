Hi all, just trying out the "mailing list" for all us coders.  At the least, it 
was easier on me than putting all your names in each time I wanted to email 
everybody.  Mind sending an email back to the list (rorss-dev at lists.berlios.de) 
to let me know your email forwarding from your_nick at users.berlios.de is 
working?  (Note: anybody can post to the list, so use whatever you want to post)

Thanks,

--
