Hi all,

Here's the info about installing TortoiseSVN and such:

http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/rorss-dev/Week-of-Mon-20051226/000006.html

I broke it down real simple-like (not to be condescending, Phil...) so 
you hopefully will have no problems installing it. You can all 
checkout the sources and edit them on your own computer now.

For those of you that have something to be getting ready for Thursday,
just make sure you're on your way to getting there. If you could check
it in to the svn tree, that would be awesome too so we can all see 
what you've done. We need to have something working by Spring Break. 
If you don't remember what you should be working on, just shoot me an 
email and I'll let you know as best I can. For you all to whom I 
didn't get to talk to much on Thursday, email (or IM) me and I can 
suggest something you could do for this Thursday.

Also, I'm working on getting a new room for us. Who knows if this will 
actually pan out, but I'm hoping it will. The Linux lab is too poorly 
setup for really any project to have a reasonable expectation of using.

Anyways, I'll see you all Thursday!
