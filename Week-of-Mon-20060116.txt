So is Wednesday bad for everybody the whole semester then?  Thursday is kind of
a long day for both me and Julian, but it's doable.  Why don't you all let me
know which evenings (I'm thinking 7-8 or 8-9) are good for you.  I don't mind
meeting after or during the design meetings on Wednesdays this semester, either.

We're gonna have to kick it up a notch early on since we're very crucial to the
whole project.  Hope to see you all this week (hopefully tomorrow evening)!
