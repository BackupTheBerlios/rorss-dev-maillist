When are we first meeting this semester?  This thursday I'm seeing george carlin, so I'm not really available.  Wednesday night is out for me, too.

Hope you're relaxing and enjoying the good grades from Fall.  Now it's 
time for me to harass you about coding :)

The easiest way for you Windows users to grab the sources - and, believe 
me, it's very easy, I just did it on our very own Lappy the PSUMS Laptop 
- is to install TortoiseSVN [1], which is a small shell extension.  
Download [2] and install it, and access to our subversion repo is almost 
at a right-click.  Make a new folder for the code, then right-click on 
the folder and select "SVN Checkout...".  Enter 
"svn+ssh://devname at svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/rorss/trunk" (w/o quotes 
and using your berlios login instead of "devname" of course) and click 
OK.  Once you've done this and entered your password the obligatory 3 
times, you'll have a working copy of the repo!  Edit any file however 
you want to, right-click, and "SVN Commit" it.  Want to get the latest 
code of somebody else's?  Right-click and select "SVN Update" on the 
folder or individual file.  Questions - email this list.

I think pghurwitz, mikesfenton, and I know the most about the hash table 
idea to abstract gestures away from rover functions, so why don't you 
guys do what you can on the higher-level stuff.  If that means making 
new files, go for it.  We also should be putting the header of the GPL-2 
license in our code, and that shouldn't take too long.  Although we 
never really discussed it, I think releasing what we do is part of our 
mission as a research organization.  If you have an issue with this, 
email this list...I want to hear back from you guys and know you're alive!

It seems like this is just a "do something" email, but if I were more 
specific, this would be much longer...and I know you all have better 
stuff to do than read emails ;)  So, at the least, you could install 
TortoiseSVN.  At the most, you could be creative and do what you think 
needs to be done (or talk to me about it).

As always, I'm hanging out in #mars-society on irc.freenode.net and on 
AIM.  Hope you all are well...
