Subject: [rorss-dev] Parallel port for lappy
Message-ID: <4404C2A1.2030602@psu.edu>

Hi guys,

We just bought a Keyspan Mini Port Replicator (which will give Lappy
the parallel port she desperately needs), so I'll try to get it all
set up to work on before our meeting Thursday.  Is everybody able to
make it?  I'm thinking we'll just meet in the Linux lab as usual; I
can bring Lappy for somebody to work on and maybe Phil can bring his
laptop too.
